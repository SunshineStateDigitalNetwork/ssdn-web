This FREE one day workshop will introduce participants to the DPLA.  Participants will leave with a better understanding of what DPLA is, how to use it as a resource, and about Florida’s involvement with DPLA through the new Sunshine State Digital Network (SSDN).  Learn more about how to get involved and prepare your metadata for inclusion.  We welcome anyone in the Florida library and museum community to attend. Attendees will receive a small stipend to help offset the cost of travel.
